# Funes Notes

Notes for iOS, stored on your Urbit ship

## Requirements

- An Urbit ship.  Really any ship will work: planet, comet, fakezod,
  galaxy.  All you need is to be running over HTTPS.  If you need
  assistance in doing that, [go here for instructions](https://urbit.org/using/os/basics#configuring-ssl)
- You should have all the latest updates installed.  This app saves your
  data to Graph Store.  It's tested on the latest version of Graph
  Store.  While it will possibly work just fine on older versions, I
  wouldn't bet on it.

## Troubleshooting

If the app seems to be in a weird state, here are some things to try:

- Bring up the list of notes, and pull down.  This will force the list
  of notes to sync up with Graph Store.

- Also, please let me know about this!  Send a DM to ~ribben-donnyl,
  post something about it in the group, send a carrier pigeon.
